# Optimal Form Guide Image Requirement

The Optimal Form Guide page requires a background image named `optimal-form-guide.jpg` to be placed in the `public/images` directory.

## Image Specifications:
- Filename: `optimal-form-guide.jpg`
- Location: `public/images/`
- Size: Similar to other guide images (approximately 203KB)
- Content: An image showing proper running form, ideally showing both male and female runners with good posture

## Temporary Solution:
Until a proper image is created, you can temporarily use one of the existing images by copying it:

```bash
# From the project root directory
cp public/images/start-running.jpg public/images/optimal-form-guide.jpg
```

This will allow the page to display properly while a more appropriate image is being prepared.
